  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A perfect plate for afternoon tea or cup of coffee.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup pitted and chopped dates, or to taste</li>

    <li>¼ cup cold water, or as needed</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>

    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or more to taste</li>

    <li>1⅜ cups self-rising flour</li>

    <li>¾ cup margarine</li>

    <li>1 cup oats</li>

    <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square
      baking dish.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine dates, water, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla extract in a
      saucepan; cook and stir over medium heat until filling mixture forms a
      paste, about 5 minutes. Add more water if filling gets too thick. Remove
      saucepan from heat and cool.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place flour in a bowl and rub margarine into flour using your hands until
      mixture resembles bread crumbs; stir in oats and 3/4 cup sugar. Press 1/2
      of the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Spoon filling over over
      crust, smoothing with the back of the spoon, leaving a thin border between
      the filling and the edge of the dish. Sprinkle the remaining crumble
      mixture over filling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven until top is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>
