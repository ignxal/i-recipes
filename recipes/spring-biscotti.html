  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>

    <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>

    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    <li>2 eggs</li>

    <li>1 egg white</li>

    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>

    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

    <li>2 ounces white chocolate, chopped</li>

    <li>½ cup dried cranberries</li>

    <li>1¼ cups pistachio nuts</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a large bowl, cream together butter, sugar, orange zest, and vanilla
      with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs and egg white
      one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift together the flour,
      baking powder, and salt; gradually blend into the creamed mixture using a
      wooden spoon. Stir in the white chocolate, dried cranberries, and
      pistachios. Cover, and chill for 30 minutes, or until dough is no longer
      sticky.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with
      parchment paper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface, and divide into halves. Form
      each half into a flattish log about 12 inches long by 3 inches wide.
      Arrange logs at least 3 inches apart on baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for 30 minutes in preheated oven, or until pale gold. Allow logs to
      cool on the baking sheet until cool enough to handle. On a cutting board,
      cut logs crosswise on a diagonal into 1 inch thick slices. Arrange on
      baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until golden. Transfer biscotti to
      wire racks, and cool completely. Store in an airtight container at room
      temperature.
    </li>
  </ol>
